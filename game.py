"""
We created a game based slightly off of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. There are two players who each control
a spaceship and protect an area from invading enemy spaceships. The user spaceships can only move left and right,
and shoot a projectile that c![](8TGboEqGc.png)an explode an enemy invader on impact. The players cannot win and continue to shoot
the enemy spaceships until they reach a red line. However, the longer the players last, the faster the enemies fall
down the screen. The collectible is the coin that increases the players' score. There is a score displayed in the
corner of the screen, which is a created by adding how many ships have been destroyed and how many coins have
been collected.
"""

""" 3 Basic Features
User input - This feature will be incorporated through keyboard input, with movement keys for both players and also
firing keys

Game over - The game ends if any of the incoming invaders reach the bottom of the screen before the player eliminates 
them. The speed of the invaders will progressively get faster as the game goes on. It will be incorporated by having a boolean value 
representing if the game is currently running or not.

Images  - This feature will be incorporated in every visible object in the game. We will also use different image files/sprite 
sheets to represent the playersâ€™ spaceship, the enemy invaders, the missiles, explosion effect, and background.

"""
""" 4 Additional Features
Sprite Animation - We created sprite animation by using a sprite-sheet to show an explosion whenever an enemy is 
hit by a player's missile. 

Collectables - We created a collectible coin that falls from the top of the screen and can be collected by the players. 
It moves faster than the base speed of the enemy ships, so it is more difficult to catch but counts for the 
equivalent of shooting 10 enemy ships.

Two Players - We created two different spaceships to be controlled by two players. Each fires and functions 
independently of the other.

Restart - We created a replay-able game, that is to say once the players lose they can hit "space" to restart the 
game and play again.
"""
"""
Changes:
We decided to not implement powerups as collectibles but instead created coins as collectibles that boost the score. 
We also decided to get rid of the asteroids as a hinderance because we didn't need them anymore to fulfill the 
4 special requirements. We also decided to not do sprite animation for the ships but instead only for the explosion. 
There is also no way to win, which we originally were going to have a limited amount of enemies and once they are 
dealt with the players would win. Now, the enemies are infinite and their falling speed increases as the game goes on. 
The score is also composited differently, with it originally being the number of enemy ships destroyed. It now is 
calculated by 10 points per ship and 100 points per coin. The final change was that our 4th requirement of enemies is 
now a restartable game (although we still do technically have enemies).
